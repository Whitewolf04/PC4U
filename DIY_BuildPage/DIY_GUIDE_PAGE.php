						<h2 id="partsdefinition">What You'll Need</h2>
						<p>
							This list comprises of the fundamental parts that you'll need to build any kind of PC, whether it be for gaming or home office work, along with a short description for each part.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Motherboard
								</h3>
								The board where all your computer parts are connected.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Processor
								</h3>
								The Central Processing Unit(CPU) that handles all the tasks and gives instructions to all the other computer parts.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Graphics Card
								</h3>
								The Graphics Processing Unit(GPU) that processes visual data. The graphics card is important for gaming, video and photo editing software, etc.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Storage
								</h3>
								Storage is where all of your PC's files will be stored.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Memory
								</h3>
								Memory is where temporary data is stored, making it very important for software.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Power Supply
								</h3>
								The power supply supplies electricity to all of your PC's components.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Case
								</h3>
								The box where all of your PC's components are put together.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>
									Operating System
								</h3>

							How to Put it All Together
						</h2>
						With the motherboard, there should be an instruction manual that lists and shows all the sockets for your PC's components. Make sure to consult it regularly while you install the other parts.
						<ol>
							<li>
								<h3>Installing the CPU</h3>
								The CPU has a side with a bunch of small pins. <span>Do not touch them, they are very fragile.</span><br>
								On your motherboard, there should be a processor socket. Unlock it, then align the processor with the golden triangle on its corner and the one on the motherboard, place it into the socket, and lock the processor into place.<br>
								Now that the processor is in place, put a dab of thermal paste onto the center of the processor on the silicon square.<br>
								Align the heat sink with the screws around the processor and lower it onto the paste, squishing it into a thin layer.<br>
								If thermal paste overflows over the edge of the processor, use isopropyl alcohol and a wipe to clean off all the thermal paste from the processor and start over.<br>
								Wait until it dries, then screw the heat sink into place. Once that's done, plug in the heat sink's cooling fan.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Installing the Motherboard</h3>
								Line up the screw holes of the motherboard with those of your case, and screw it in.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Installing the Power Supply</h3>
								The power supply is fitted and screwed into a square slot in the case.<br>
								<span>Make sure the power supply cables reach the motherboard.</span>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Installing the GPU</h3>
								Plug the GPU into the PCIe slot in your motherboard.<br>
								The back of the GPU with the HDMI and DisplayPorts should also line up with the back of your case and fit with relative ease.<br>
								The power supply should have a cable that can be inserted into the GPU, the socket looks like it has six or eight holes.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Installing Storage and Memory</h3>
								Beside the CPU, on the motherboard, there should be vertical sockets where you can insert your sticks of RAM for memory needs.<br>
								<span>Consult your motherboard's instruction manual for which slots to use.</span><br>
								For an HD or SSD, there should be an empty bay in the case where you can slot and screm them into place.<br>
								For an M.2 drive, there should be a slot on your motherboard where you can insert one.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Managing the Cables</h3>
								Plug your motherboard into all the other components with their respective cables.<br>
								Hook up your power supply to all your other components, most importantly, to your SSD and motherboard.<br>
								Hook up your motherboard to its case, meaning specifically, the power buttons, audio plugs, and USB ports on the front of you case.<br>
								<span>Hook up computer fans to your case as well that then connect to your motherboard.</span><br>
								Your SSD also connects to your motherboard with its SATA cable.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Install your Operating System</h3>
								Turn on your PC. If it starts up with no issues, then turn it off and plug in a flash drive with Windows on it.<br>
								Turn on your PC again and it should boot up with Windows automatically. Otherwise, set the drive as a boot device in your BIOS.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Congratulations, you have built a PC.</h3>
								When it comes down to it, building a PC can seem like a very stressful and arduous task, but in reality, it is straight-forward and merely requires that you have patience and follow instructions.<br>
								Now that the long and hard work is over, your custom hand-built PC will open you up to a vastly bigger digital realm of possibilities and utilities than that of your standard, run-of-the-mill Dell Office PC.

						<h2 id="buyingguide">Guide to Buying the Right PC Parts for You</h2>
						Really, the most difficult part of bulding a PC is choosing the right parts to buy. You have to keep in mind compatibility between parts, the specs you have in mind, 
						and most importantly your <span>budget</span>. Here are a few recommended guides and links to different articles and videos that can help guide you to really choosing what you want.

						This video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWQ0gDrqOCarmUKmppD7GQ">JayTwoCentz</a> is a good guide for beginners choosing the right PC parts for their build.
						It offers great advice on how to build your PC and it even goes through Jay's buying process for a PC with a budget of $1000.
						<br>
						<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
						This is a highly important topic when it comes to buying the right PC parts for you.
						 You do not want to mess this part up so you can avoid a situation where you have a bunch of incompatible parts when you're about to build your PC.<br><br>
						 This <a href="https://www.wepc.com/how-to/make-sure-all-pc-components-compatible/?fbclid=IwAR3b-B3boKD9wzQdH4qjA-sIT2ujUlMRdOW61kpoTqS8f0oetaPa2Jfj0u0">guide</a> by Andrew from WePC gives a clear rundown of what you should be looking when it comes to finding compatible parts.
						<h2 id="picking">Picking the Parts</h2>
						This section is for understanding what parts to choose from based on their most important specs.
						 <h3>What to look for in a CPU</h3>
						When looking at the specs of CPUs, GHz are what you'll want to focus on. It indicates how many cycles a second are processed in that CPU. The more GHz it has the better it is.
						<h3>What to look for in a GPU</h3>
						When looking at the GPUs, you'll want to choose among the big brand names, Nvidia, AMD, and MSI. You'll also want to look out for the GPU's bandwidth compatibility memory size.
						<h3>What to look for in a Hard Drive</h3>
						Primarily, you'll want to focus on how much GBs(gigabytes) or TBs(terabytes) it could store. If you're building a gaming pc, then it would be better to get a lot of storage and a SSD(solid state drive) to load your games faster.
						<h3>What to look for in Motherboard</h3>
						It's important to see which slots a motherboard has and its shape to see if all your parts can fit onto the motherboard. Generally, it's better to have a newer model.
						<h3>What to look for in RAM</h3>
						When looking for RAM, you should choose based on its amount of storage. Typically, 16GB is enough.
						<h3>What to look for in a Power Supply</h3>
						You'll want to buy one that has a lot of wattage and voltage. However, you can optimize this by finding out how much power your PC would theoretically consume and buying a PSU that supplies that right amount.
						 To calculate this, you can use this <a href="https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator">power supply calculator</a>.
